## JAN 13th 2025
 First Commit 
 - Added two objects MonteCarlo() and Simulation().
 - Set up fields and basic getter functions for objects.
 - Set up constructors for manual and auto instantiation.

 Goals by next commit(~2 weeks later)
 - Set up geometric brownian motion with java.
 - Implment a successful single path simulation
 - Contain all paths in a 2D array
 - Connect to R?

 
 ## JAN 14th 2025
 - Encapsulated and expanded simulation parameters to object MonteCarlo
 - Sucessful initiation of 2D array `[Simulation][double]`.
 - Implemented brownian motion with java Array tools.
 - Created simple developer methods to test single GBM simulations

 Goals by next commit(soon?)
 - Use java's R library
 - implement and LEARN Maven dev tools
 - implement multithread computation
 - create write.csv method
 - optimize computation

 ## JAN 23rd 2025
 - Added simple JUnit Testing
