## MONTE CARLO SIMULATOR
Monte carlo simulator using geometric brownian motion to simulate stock sentiment.

How to use:
Currently the UI is very unfriendly. Currently you can run from Simulation.java and CSVWriter.java.
1. For quickest visualization, run from CSVWriter.
2. In main method, set parameters to the constructor of the Monte Carlo object.
3. Running this file should then write all the data down into data/sims.
4. Then go to scripts/analysis and run analysis. (might be sum path bugs).
5. PNG of visualization will showup in scripts/visuals.

DEMO: 
- Currently loaded in test.csv is a stock sim of Google with 300 simulations at 500 steps.
- The visualization is in script/visuals/GOOGL.png


Thank You!
