## MONTE CARLO SIMULATOR
Monte carlo simulator using geometric brownian motion to simulate stock sentiment.

How to use:
Currently the UI is very unfriendly. If you wish to start computation:
1. Open main file (some demo code for a single simulation of apple stock)
2. Use .MonteCarlo(); to instantiate a simulation with unique parameters
3. Use .runAll(); to run all parralel GBM or select single simulation and use .run();
4. Use displayPath(); to see stock path.

Thank You!
